Type casting 
these are of two types those are:-
1.Implict Type Casting 
2.Explict Casting
Implict Type Casting:- it changes small data type into large data type
It is Automatic and safe
No Data Loss
Order:-
byte → short → int → long → float → double

Explict Type Casting:- It changes from bigger data type to smaller data type 
It must be done Manually and data loss

Coding :-

class TypeCasting{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        int a=25;
        double b=a;//automatic casting 
        System.out.println("Implict type Casting");
         System.out.println("\nBefore casting ");
        System.out.println("int value " +a);
         System.out.println("\nAfter casting");
         
        System.out.println("double value "+b);
        
        //Explict type casting
        
        double c=20.98;
        int d=(int) a;
         System.out.println("\nExplict type casting");
          System.out.println("\nBefore casting");
          
           System.out.println("double value "+c);
           System.out.println("\nAfter casting");
           System.out.println("int value "+d);
          
        
        
    }
}
this coding refers both type casting 
first create class
then main function using static object
and then declare small data type int with variable a give the value
and for bigger data type double with variable declaring b=a it automatically cast into small
and the print satements +a refers like calling that variable what value you want  keep+ and the write that 
same for explict but here first declare bigger data type 
and then do manually int d=(int) a here d reseembles int a means value changes to integer
