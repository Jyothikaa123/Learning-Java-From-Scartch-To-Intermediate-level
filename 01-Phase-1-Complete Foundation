What is Java?
It is High Level Programing Language and Object-Oriented ,Platform independent 
Platform independent-The Program that runs on different platforms without changing the code
Why Java is platform independent :-Java follows the rule:-WORA:-Wright Once Run Anywhere So that's the reason for java is platform independent
️
JDK, JRE, JVM (Students fear this — let’s simplify)
JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
Runs Java programs
Exists inside your computer
JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
JVM + libraries
Needed to run Java programs
JDK (Java Development Kit)
JRE + compiler
Needed to write & run Java programs

Structure of Java Program?
Every Java Program has :-
1.class:-blueprint of the object
2.A main method
3.Statements inside the main

Example with code:-
class ClassName{ 
public static vid main(String[]args){
System.out.println("Hi This is Jyothikaa");
}} 

try the above code you can write in (System.out.println) this your name or anything like what you the output  
//this is the main function using static it is class itself not the object it helps the program to run without creating the object void:-print something without giving any value back
here ClassName is the Program Name
String[] args:
Used to take command-line input
args is an array of Strings
Example:
java Program Hello
Here:
args[0] = "Hello"
println:-prints the output and goes to next line

mandatory steps to write code in java
first create a class a
second create the funtion using static object as above i said 
third then statements like creating varibles or something(scanner method)
