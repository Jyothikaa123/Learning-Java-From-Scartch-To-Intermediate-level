Note:In else should not written anything

//3rd problem-Prime number
//First let us understand what is prime number the number must leaves remainder only when it is divisible by itself means it must not leaves remainder 0 when it is divisible by another number other than itself
//read it it will make easy for code understanding

class PrimeNumber{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        int n=567;
        boolean isPrime=true;
        if(n<=1){
            isPrime=false;
            
        }
        else{
            for( int i=2;i<n;i++){
                if(n%i==0){
                    isPrime=false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if(isPrime){
            System.out.println(n+ "is a prime number");
            
        }
        else{
             System.out.println(n+ "is not a prime number");
             
        }
        
    }
}
ok now let us do code break down 
you know the structure of java creating classthose all
i am going to the direct logic
first assign a number 
and then assume the number is true
and now contions for false means number must be less than  or equal to 1
and number should not be divisible by numbers and leaves remainder
