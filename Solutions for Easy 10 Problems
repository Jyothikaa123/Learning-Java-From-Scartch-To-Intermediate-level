//3rd problem-Prime number
//First let us understand what is prime number the number must leaves remainder only when it is divisible by itself means it must not leaves remainder 0 when it is divisible by another number other than itself
//read it it will make easy for code understanding

class PrimeNumber{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        int n=567;
        boolean isPrime=true;
        if(n<=1){
            isPrime=false;
            
        }
        else{
            for( int i=2;i<n;i++){
                if(n%i==0){
                    isPrime=false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if(isPrime){

    }
}

ok now let us do code break down 
you know the structure of java creating classthose all
i am going to the direct logic
first assign a number 
and then assume the number is true
and now contions for false means number must be less than  or equal to 1
and number should not be divisible by numbers and leaves remainder 0 
for this go and chesck for loop first intialization starting with 2 because 1 is not a prime number before we declared it and then condition i<nmeans number upto n from 2 and then i++ means continues (it will add till n)
in if sstatement n%1=0 means % - it refers to the rremainder when nis divided by i leaves remainder 0 then not a prime 
break means if we found the divisor then stop right there time will be saved
if(isPrime) refers to the isPrime == true java will understand in else isPrime== false

//4 th problem 
//Fibonacci Series

it means adding previous numbers 
it means if first number 0 and second number 1 
0 1 now add these both 2
0 1 2 now add 1 and 2 it gives 3
0 1 2 3 like this it contiues adding previous numbers 

class FibonacciSeries{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n=20;
        int first=0;
        int second=1;
      System.out.print( first+ " " + second+ " ");
        //here we uses print because we dont want ln next line i want in same line
        for( int i=3;i<n;i++){
            int next=first+second;
            System.out .print(next+ " ");
            first=second;
            second=next;
            
        }
    }
}
here in this code let us first set how many terms we want and then assing first term and second term as your wish there are no conditions 
now print first and second i make it same in same line so i used print only 
we go into the logic i starts with 3 rd term because we gave first and second terms it goes until n 
then main logic adding previous numbers int next =first +second 
printing those numbers 
and then heart of the programing 
first =second,second=next   means in 0 1 first is 0 second is 1
by adding becomes 2 = next
now 1 will become first 2 will become second 
like this  it continues 
Note:-Don't forget keeping int in for because for declaring i
